### Research
[File Layout](https://github.com/ScribeEzra/CST---391/blob/main/Media/Activity%202/FileLayout.png)
> Above, you can see the file structure for my default testapp project. 
> Searching through this layout, I cannot find node_modules anywhere so I can't study it and exlain what it's purpose is. Perhaps I skipped an installation step?
> src is the source folder which is used to organize the code files. Folders within this folder are used to package code files that relate to eachother.
> src/app contains all of the component files as well as configuration files for the app itself.
> src/assets contains a .gitkeep file which allows an empty folder to be tracked using a git.
> src/environments is missing from my folder layout, but I can easily assume it's used to hold the environment code files.
> angular.json is meant to hold the settings for angular. 
> app.component.css is used to define the CSS designs of the application.
> tsconfid.json is the configuration file for typescript.
