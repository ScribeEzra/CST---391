### Overview

___

> The goal of CST-391’s Milestone project is to build two near-identical applications to be run on Express-
> one through React and another through Angular. The applications themselves should be designed to support a product, integrate REST API’s. and simulate CRUD operations.
> It is also suggested that we attempt to use a theme befitting of the Christian worldview.

### Introduction

> To fulfil the requirements of this class project, I’ve decided to create two similar biblical bestiary applications using React and Angular to be run using Express.
> A bestiary is defined as “a collection of descriptions or representations of real or imaginary animals.” (Webster, n.d.)
> In this case, I am creating the kind of bestiaries often found in RPG video games such as Final Fantasy. This application will support a creature class as the product.
> The creature class will have variables such as a “description” string, a “health” int, an “attack” int, a “defense” int, and a “unique” boolean.
> An example of a biblical creature in the creature class would be
>
> **Leviathan**
> - **Description:** A massive sea serpent with a seemingly unending amount of teeth, believed by some to have possibly been the possessed serpent in the Garden of Eden
> - **Health:** 999999
> - **Attack:** 280
> - **Defense:** 500
> - **Unique:** true

### Functionality

---

> As a user, I want to be able to view a product list, read product details, and simulate CRUD functions using both applications.
